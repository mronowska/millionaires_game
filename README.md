##Mililionaires game using Python, modules and Faker  

### Millionaires
In this game you have to answer 12 questions correctly. There are 3 lifebuoys to choose from: a phone call to a friend, an audience hint, and the rejection of two incorrect answers.
Every correct answer means more dollars in the account. You can win a million $$$! The game is over when the player answers the question incorrectly.

### My game

To go to the next steps, press any key.

Questions, answers and question categories are stored in the csv file.

Friends' names are pulled randomly from the Faker extension. If the category of a friend coincides with the category of the question, the friend will always tell you well. If not, the choice of answer is random.

Audience responses are random, the sum of the response percentages is 100%.

Retrieving data from the user takes until a valid value is given.
